# Recommendation-System---Big-Basket

# Recommendation System for Big Basket

This repository contains the code and analysis for a recommendation system built for Big Basket, a leading online grocery store. The goal of this project is to provide personalized product recommendations to customers based on their purchasing behavior.

## Project Overview

The project involves the following key steps:
1. Pre-processing: Cleaning and transforming the raw data into a suitable format for analysis.
2. Modeling: Applying algorithms to extract patterns and generate recommendations.
3. Results: Presenting the outcomes of the applied models.
4. Analysis & Insights: Interpreting the results to derive meaningful insights.
5. Challenges & Considerations: Discussing the obstacles faced and considerations for improvement.

## Technical Skills and Tools

The following technical skills and tools were utilized in this project:

- **Python**: Core programming language used for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Pandas**: For data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis.
- **Mlxtend**: For implementing the Apriori algorithm and mining association rules.
- **Scikit-learn**: For calculating pairwise distances in collaborative filtering.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: For data visualization and exploratory data analysis.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive code development and documentation.

## Steps

### Pre-processing

In this step, the raw data is cleaned and transformed to prepare it for analysis. Key tasks include handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.

### Modeling

#### Frequent Itemsets Mining
- **Apriori Algorithm**: Identifying sets of items that frequently co-occur in transactions.

#### Association Rules Mining
- **Association Rules**: Deriving rules that highlight relationships between items, providing the basis for recommendations.

#### Collaborative Filtering
- **User-Based Filtering**: Recommending items based on similarities between users.
- **Item-Based Filtering**: Recommending items based on similarities between items.

### Results

The results section presents the frequent itemsets discovered, the association rules generated, and the performance metrics of the collaborative filtering models. Visualizations and performance metrics help to evaluate the effectiveness of the recommendation system.

### Analysis & Insights

Detailed analysis and insights are derived from the results:
- **Frequent Patterns**: Identifying which products are often bought together.
- **User Behavior**: Understanding customer preferences and purchasing patterns.
- **Model Performance**: Evaluating the accuracy and relevance of the recommendations provided by different models.

### Challenges & Considerations

Several challenges were encountered during the project:
- **Data Sparsity**: Handling sparse data in collaborative filtering.
- **Scalability**: Ensuring the system can scale with the growing data size.
- **Cold Start Problem**: Addressing the challenge of providing recommendations for new users and items.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Choosing appropriate metrics to evaluate the recommendation system's performance.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is `IMB575 (Customer Analytics at Bigbasket - Product Recommendations, Spreadsheet).csv`, which contains transaction records of customers.

## Code and Analysis

The Jupyter Notebook `Recommendation System, Big Basket.ipynb` contains the complete code and analysis for the recommendation system. It includes detailed explanations and visualizations to help understand the process and results.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the application of various data science techniques to build a recommendation system. It showcases the use of frequent itemsets mining, association rules mining, and collaborative filtering to provide personalized recommendations to customers.
